    For the tests, a simliar test plan was done on project 2. All invalid inputs for the menu options and requests for account numbers were properly rejected, and did not proceed to run the program. When running project_debug was ran, additional debug options were properly printed for function calls, while project running in normal mode do not. Constructor and destructor were properly called, with readfile being called in the constructor (llist(char name[]), and writefile and cleanup being called once the user chooses to quit.

    Additionally, for the extra credit constructor/methods, the copy constructor is able to create the llist from an existing list; the assignment operator assigns the new values of the already initialized llist from another existing llist. the code to test for them is left as comments. NOTE: While constructing more than one link list in main causes the destructor to be called more than once, under the scope of project2, it is assumed that only one llist exists in main (thus the reason for the extra credit constructor/assignment to be left as comments).

    Overall, the project is able to successfully run as intented, both in normal and debugmode.
